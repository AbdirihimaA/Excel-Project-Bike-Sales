# Bike Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard

## Introduction

This project focuses on analysing customer data to understand the factors that influence bike purchases. The dataset contains demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting information about individuals and whether or not they have purchased a bike. The analysis aims to answer several key business questions, including:
- **Does income level affect bike purchases?**
- **Which age groups are more likely to buy a bike?**
- **How does the distance of a customer’s commute impact their likelihood of purchasing a bike?**
- **What role do factors like gender, marital status, education, and region play in bike purchases?**

The data is visualised through a dashboard that summarises the insights using interactive charts and slicers. The dashboard is designed to allow users to easily filter and explore different aspects of the data to gain meaningful insights for decision-making, such as marketing strategies or customer segmentation.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following key columns:
- **ID**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Marital Status**: Whether the customer is married or single.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Income**: The customer's annual income.
- **Children**: The number of children the customer has.
- **Education**: The highest level of education attained by the customer.
- **Occupation**: The type of job the customer has.
- **Home Owner**: Whether the customer owns their home.
- **Cars**: Number of cars owned by the customer.
- **Commute Distance**: How far the customer travels for their daily commute.
- **Region**: The geographic region where the customer lives.
- **Age**: The customer's age.
- **Purchased Bike**: Indicates whether or not the customer has purchased a bike.

## Questions Answered by the Dashboard

The dashboard answers the following key questions:
1. **Does gender and income affect bike purchases?**: By comparing income levels across gender, we can determine if men or women are more likely to buy a bike based on their income.
2. **Which age group purchases the most bikes?**: By examining age brackets, we can see which age group tends to purchase more bikes.
3. **Does commuting distance influence bike purchases?**: By plotting the number of bikes purchased against different commuting distances, we can explore whether individuals with shorter or longer commutes are more likely to purchase a bike.
4. **How do marital status, education, and region affect purchasing behaviour?**: Using slicers, we can filter the data to examine the influence of these factors.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard contains the following visualisations and interactive elements:

### 1. **Average Income Per Purchase (Bar Chart)**

   - **What it shows**: This bar chart displays the average income of customers who purchased a bike versus those who did not, broken down by gender.
   - **Insights**: 
     - This chart helps us understand whether income levels differ significantly between men and women, and between customers who bought a bike and those who did not.
     - For example, the chart shows that men who bought bikes tend to have a higher average income than women who bought bikes.

### 2. **Customer Age Brackets (Line Chart)**

   - **What it shows**: This line chart compares the number of customers who purchased a bike versus those who did not across different age groups: Young Adult, Middle-Aged, and Old.
   - **Insights**: 
     - This chart allows us to see which age groups are more likely to buy bikes.
     - The data suggests that middle-aged customers are the most likely to purchase a bike, while younger and older customers have lower purchase rates.

### 3. **Customer Commute (Line Chart)**

   - **What it shows**: This line chart displays the number of bike purchases and non-purchases in relation to the customer’s commuting distance.
   - **Insights**: 
     - This chart helps identify whether customers with shorter or longer commutes are more likely to buy a bike.
     - It appears that customers with shorter commutes (0-1 Miles) are more likely to purchase bikes, while those with longer commutes are less inclined to do so.

### 4. **Slicers (Filters)**

   - **What they do**: Slicers are included for:
     - **Marital Status** (Married, Single)
     - **Education** (e.g., Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School)
     - **Region** (Europe, North America, Pacific)
   - **How they work**: These slicers allow users to filter the charts by different demographic factors, offering a more granular analysis of the data. For instance:
     - Filtering by **Marital Status** can show if married or single customers are more likely to purchase bikes.
     - Filtering by **Region** can highlight geographic differences in purchasing behaviour.
   - **Example Use**: A user could filter the dashboard to focus solely on married customers in Europe to see how their purchasing patterns differ from other groups.

## Conclusion

This project provides a detailed analysis of bike purchasing behaviour using customer demographic and socioeconomic data. The dashboard enables stakeholders to interact with the data dynamically, offering the flexibility to explore different customer segments and draw meaningful conclusions. By understanding how factors like income, age, and commute distance affect purchasing decisions, companies can tailor their marketing and sales strategies to better meet the needs of their target audiences.
